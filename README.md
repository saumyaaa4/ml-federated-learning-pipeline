# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Pipeline (MNIST)

## Project Description
Privacy-preserving federated learning pipeline using TensorFlow Federated. Multiple clients train locally, server aggregates updates, achieving ~91% global accuracy on MNIST. Demonstrates ML/AI model training without sharing raw data, scalable & modular for real-world applications.

## Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Federated
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
